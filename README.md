Purpose of the webpage:
The purpose of this webpage is to demonstrate the use of semantic HTML elements for better structure, readability, and accessibility. It serves as a basic template that can be expanded upon for blogs, articles, or informational websites.

List of semantic elements used:
<header>
<nav>
<article>
<section>
<aside>
<footer>

Accessibility considerations applied:
Proper Heading Structure: The page follows a logical heading hierarchy (<h1> for the main title, <h2> for subsections) to improve screen reader navigation.
Alt Attributes for Images: The <img> tag includes an alt attribute to provide descriptive text for visually impaired users.
Semantic HTML: Elements like <nav>, <article>, and <aside> improve the document's meaning, making it easier for assistive technologies to interpret.
Readable Navigation Links: The <nav> section uses a list structure (<ul>) for better organization and accessibility.
