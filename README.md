# Semantic HTML Webpage

## Purpose of the Webpage
The purpose of this webpage is to demonstrate the use of semantic HTML elements for better structure, readability, and accessibility. It serves as a basic template that can be expanded upon for blogs, articles, or informational websites.

## List of Semantic Elements Used
- `<header>`
- `<nav>`
- `<article>`
- `<section>`
- `<aside>`
- `<footer>`

## Accessibility Considerations Applied
- **Proper Heading Structure:** The page follows a logical heading hierarchy (`<h1>` for the main title, `<h2>` for subsections) to improve screen reader navigation.
- **Alt Attributes for Images:** The `<img>` tag includes an `alt` attribute to provide descriptive text for visually impaired users.
- **Semantic HTML:** Elements like `<nav>`, `<article>`, and `<aside>` improve the document's meaning, making it easier for assistive technologies to interpret.
- **Readable Navigation Links:** The `<nav>` section uses a list structure (`<ul>`) for better organization and accessibility.
